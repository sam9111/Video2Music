# Video2Music

ðŸŽµ Auto-generate music for your videos!ðŸŽµ

Elevate your short videos with Video2Music! Frames are extracted every 2 seconds and decoded with InstructBLIP to uncover the story. Then, the Replit ModelFarm Completion model crafts a vivid video description. But that's not all â€“ it doubles as a music prompt generator, specifying instruments, genre, mood, feel, time signature, BPM, and even audio quality. Finally, the MusicGen model by Facebook composes a perfect soundtrack that syncs seamlessly with your video. Redefine your video experience with Video2Music.
