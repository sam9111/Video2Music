We extract images every 2 seconds, decoding them with InstructBLIP to uncover the story. Then, the Replit ModelFarm Completion model crafts a vivid video description. But that's not all â€“ it doubles as a music prompt generator, specifying instruments, genre, mood, feel, time signature, BPM, kbps, and kHz. Finally, MusicGen by Facebook composes a perfect soundtrack that syncs seamlessly with your video. Redefine your video experience with Video2Music.
